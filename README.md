# OpenWRT GL.iNet GL-M300N V2 Internet Restrict Switch

Set of scripts to use the side switch of the GL.iNet GL-M300N as an Internet block/allow toggle on vanilla OpenWRT (untested on stock firmware).

Copy all the files except this README to the root to enable.

The script expects the firewall zones to be called 'wan' and 'lan'. Modify as needed.
